> **Note**: Using [Optuna Sweeper](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/optuna_sweeper) doesn't require you to add any boilerplate to your code, everything is defined in a [single config file](configs/hparams_search/mnist_optuna.yaml).

> **Warning**: Optuna sweeps are not failure-resistant (if one job crashes then the whole sweep crashes).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Execute all experiments from folder</b></summary>

```bash
python train.py -m 'experiment=glob(*)'
```

> **Note**: Hydra provides special syntax for controlling behavior of multiruns. Learn more [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/multi-run). The command above executes all experiments from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Use tags</b></summary>

Each experiment should be tagged in order to easily filter them across files or in logger UI:

```bash
python train.py tags=["mnist", "experiment_X"]
```

If no tags are provided, you will be asked to input them from command line:

```bash
>>> python train.py tags=[]
[2022-07-11 15:40:09,358][src.utils.utils][INFO] - Enforcing tags! <cfg.extras.enforce_tags=True>
[2022-07-11 15:40:09,359][src.utils.rich_utils][WARNING] - No tags provided in config. Prompting user to input tags...
Enter a list of comma separated tags (dev):
```

If no tags are provided for multirun, an error will be raised:

```bash
>>> python train.py -m +x=1,2,3 tags=[]
ValueError: Specify tags before launching a multirun!
```

> **Note**: Appending lists from command line is currently not supported in hydra :(

## Project Guidelines

This project is based on a plugin architecture and is to remain as lightweight as possible, serving merely as a connector between different downstream libraries. The main functions this framework is to serve is as follows:

- Provide experiment configuration control with Hydra config
- Provide consistent data augmentation and preprocessing steps across multiple datasets and models
- Provide reference implementations of commonly used 3D datasets using PyL
- Provide experiment tracking across a wide array of tools, e.g. Wandb and Tensorboard
- Provide PyL wrappers for downstream libraries which provide model implementations and backends

### Configuration

Refer to the [Hydra docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/intro/) for overall best practices when using Hydra configs.

Relevant configuration parameters should be provided for every model/dataset to ensure easy reproducibility (e.g. batch sizes, learning rate, schedulers, optimizers).

Configuration and code should be completely decoupled. Parameters passed to code from a Hydra config should be in the form of primitives or dataclasses, not DictConfigs or generic key/value pairs. See, for example, the usage of the `LrScheduler` dataclass to duct-type the configuration parameters in [src/models/common.py](src/models/common.py). As as result, **all code should be able to be run independently of Hydra**. Configuration files should use [hydra instantiation](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/instantiate_objects/overview/) whenever possible to support this goal.

### Datasets

Dataset preprocessing should be as minimal as possible so that the user can have maximum flexbility in how to prepare the data for their specific model or usecase. For example, rather than hardcoding data augmentations within the dataset code, data augmentations should be specified in the configuration file. Datasets should be agnostic to models, and any specific model preparation should be left to the configuration.

All datasets should be implemented within `LightningDataModule`s and inherit from `Base3dDataModule`. This data module code should handle train/test/validation splits, downloading and storing the dataset, and initializing the underlying dataset classes.

Datasets should inherit from `torch_geometric.data.Dataset`, which allows the trainer to grab the number of classes and the number of features directly from the dataset object.

The `__getitem__` function of the dataset should return a `torch_geometric.data.Data` object, with at least the keys `pos` and `y`. For proper collation, keys must be Tensor objects or primitives. For all tasks, the key `pos` will be a floating point tensor of size `(n, 3)`. For classification tasks, the key `y` will be a single integer value. For segmentation tasks, the key `y` will be stored as a tensor of integers of size `(n)`.

Features such as RGB should be stored into dedicated keys in the `Data` object. Then, these features can be added to the `x` vector dynamically by using the `AddFeatsByKey` transform.

### Models

Metrics should be implemented using the [TorchMetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library whenever possible. If a metric is not available, first try to add an implementation to the TorchMetrics repo.

Models should be implemented as much as possible via backend plugins, such as TorchSparse or OpenPoints. Then, construct a `LightningModule` which inherits from `BaseSegmentationModel` or `BaseClassificationModel` to interface with that backend. The backend model should be constructed in the module's initializer, and the `step` and `forward` functions should be used to transform the data into the appropriate format to pass to the backend model, apply the criterion, and return the predictions and loss.

## Experiment Config

Location: [configs/experiment](configs/experiment)<br>
Experiment configs allow you to overwrite parameters from main config.<br>
For example, you can use them to version control best hyperparameters for each combination of model and dataset.

<details>
<summary><b>Show example experiment config</b></summary>

```yaml
# @package _global_

# to execute this experiment run:
# python train.py experiment=example

defaults:
  - override /datamodule: mnist.yaml
  - override /model: mnist.yaml
  - override /callbacks: default.yaml
  - override /trainer: default.yaml

# all parameters below will be merged with parameters from default configurations set above
# this allows you to overwrite only specified parameters

tags: ["mnist", "simple_dense_net"]

seed: 12345

trainer:
  min_epochs: 10
  max_epochs: 10
  gradient_clip_val: 0.5

    lr: 0.002
  net:
    lin1_size: 128
    lin2_size: 256
    lin3_size: 64

datamodule:
  batch_size: 64

  wandb:
    tags: ${tags}
    group: "mnist"
```

</details>

**Experiment design**

_Say you want to execute many runs to plot how accuracy changes in respect to batch size._

1. Execute the runs with some config parameter that allows you to identify them easily, like tags:

   ```bash
   python train.py -m logger=csv datamodule.batch_size=16,32,64,128 tags=["batch_size_exp"]
   ```

2. Write a script or notebook that searches over the `logs/` folder and retrieves csv logs from runs containing given tags in config. Plot the results.

<br>

## Logs

Hydra creates new output directory for every executed run.

Default logging structure:

```
├── logs
│   ├── task_name
│   │   ├── runs                        # Logs generated by single runs
│   │   │   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS       # Datetime of the run
│   │   │   │   ├── .hydra                  # Hydra logs
│   │   │   │   ├── csv                     # Csv logs
│   │   │   │   ├── wandb                   # Weights&Biases logs
│   │   │   │   ├── checkpoints             # Training checkpoints
│   │   │   │   └── ...                     # Any other thing saved during training
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │
│   │   └── multiruns                   # Logs generated by multiruns
│   │       ├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS       # Datetime of the multirun
│   │       │   ├──1                        # Multirun job number
│   │       │   ├──2
│   │       │   └── ...
│   │       └── ...
│   │
│   └── debugs                          # Logs generated when debugging config is attached
│       └── ...
```

You can change this structure by modifying paths in [hydra configuration](configs/hydra).

<br>

## Experiment Tracking

PyTorch Lightning supports many popular logging frameworks: [Weights&Biases](https://www.wandb.com/), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/), [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org), [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/).

These tools help you keep track of hyperparameters and output metrics and allow you to compare and visualize results. To use one of them simply complete its configuration in [configs/logger](configs/logger) and run:

```bash
python train.py logger=logger_name
```

You can use many of them at once (see [configs/logger/many_loggers.yaml](configs/logger/many_loggers.yaml) for example).

You can also write your own logger.

Lightning provides convenient method for logging custom metrics from inside LightningModule. Read the [docs](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/logging.html#automatic-logging) or take a look at [MNIST example](src/models/mnist_module.py).

<br>

## Tests

Template comes with generic tests implemented with `pytest`.

```bash
# run all tests
pytest

# run tests from specific file
pytest tests/test_train.py

# run all tests except the ones marked as slow
pytest -k "not slow"
```

Most of the implemented tests don't check for any specific output - they exist to simply verify that executing some commands doesn't end up in throwing exceptions. You can execute them once in a while to speed up the development.

Currently, the tests cover cases like:

- running 1 train, val and test step
- running 1 epoch on 1% of data, saving ckpt and resuming for the second epoch
- running 2 epochs on 1% of data, with DDP simulated on CPU

And many others. You should be able to modify them easily for your use case.

There is also `@RunIf` decorator implemented, that allows you to run tests only if certain conditions are met, e.g. GPU is available or system is not windows. See the [examples](tests/test_train.py).

<br>

## Hyperparameter Search

You can define hyperparameter search by adding new config file to [configs/hparams_search](configs/hparams_search).

<details>
<summary><b>Show example hyperparameter search config</b></summary>

```yaml
# @package _global_

defaults:
  - override /hydra/sweeper: optuna

# choose metric which will be optimized by Optuna
# make sure this is the correct name of some metric logged in lightning module!
optimized_metric: "val/acc_best"

# here we define Optuna hyperparameter search
# it optimizes for value returned from function with @hydra.main decorator
hydra:
  sweeper:
    _target_: hydra_plugins.hydra_optuna_sweeper.optuna_sweeper.OptunaSweeper

    # 'minimize' or 'maximize' the objective
    direction: maximize

    # total number of runs that will be executed
    n_trials: 20

    # choose Optuna hyperparameter sampler
    # docs: https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers.html
    sampler:
      _target_: optuna.samplers.TPESampler
      seed: 1234
      n_startup_trials: 10 # number of random sampling runs before optimization starts

    # define hyperparameter search space
    params:
      model.optimizer.lr: interval(0.0001, 0.1)
      datamodule.batch_size: choice(32, 64, 128, 256)
      model.net.lin1_size: choice(64, 128, 256)
      model.net.lin2_size: choice(64, 128, 256)
      model.net.lin3_size: choice(32, 64, 128, 256)
```

</details>

Next, execute it with: `python train.py -m hparams_search=mnist_optuna`

Using this approach doesn't require adding any boilerplate to code, everything is defined in a single config file. The only necessary thing is to return the optimized metric value from the launch file.

You can use different optimization frameworks integrated with Hydra, like [Optuna, Ax or Nevergrad](https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/optuna_sweeper/).

The `optimization_results.yaml` will be available under `logs/task_name/multirun` folder.

This approach doesn't support advanced techniques like prunning - for more sophisticated search, you should probably write a dedicated optimization task (without multirun feature).
